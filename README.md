get_reader
==========

![devstatus]&#32;[![build-img]][build-url] ![pyversions] ![license]

This module provides a `get_reader()` function that returns reader
objects similar to those returned by `csv.reader()`. This package:

* reads data from a variety of sources (CSV, Excel, pandas, etc.)
* provides a single interface across Python versions (including
  seamless Unicode-aware CSV support for Python 2)
* optionally manages file handling and reduces boilerplate code
* has no hard dependencies
* tested on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 through 3.8, PyPy, PyPy3, and Jython
* is freely available under the Apache License, version 2
* can serve as a light-weight requirement for other projects or can
  be easily vendored directly into a codebase


**Open a UTF-8 encoded CSV:**

```python
from get_reader import get_reader

reader = get_reader('myfile.csv')

for row in reader:
    print(', '.join(row))
```

In the above example, file handling is managed automatically by the
reader object. The file is automatically closed when the iterator is
exhausted or when the object is deleted. It also works on Python 2
versions without changes.


**Open a Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) encoded CSV file:**

```python
...

reader = get_reader('myfile.csv', encoding='latin-1')

for row in reader:
    print(', '.join(row))
```


**Use the reader as a context manager:**

```python
...

with get_reader('myfile.csv') as reader:
    for row in reader:
        print(', '.join(row))
```


**Access other data sources:**

```python
...

# From a pandas DataFrame, Series, Index, or MultiIndex.
df = pd.DataFrame([...])
reader = get_reader(df)  # requires pandas

# From a database connection.
connection = ...
reader = get_reader(connection, 'SELECT col1, col2 FROM mytable;')

# From an Excel file--must install with 'excel' option.
reader = get_reader('myfile.xlsx')

# From a DBF file--must install with 'dbf' option.
reader = get_reader('myfile.dbf')

# From a squint Select, Query, or Result.
select = ...
reader = get_reader(select({'col1': 'col2'}).sum())
```


**Call constructors directly to override auto-detect behavior:**

```python
...

# Specify tab-delimited data from a text file.
reader = get_reader.from_csv('myfile.dat', delimiter='\t')
```


Install
-------

The `get_reader` module has no hard dependencies; is tested on
Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 through 3.8, PyPy, PyPy3, and Jython; and
is freely available under the Apache License, version 2.

You can install `get_reader` using `pip`:

```shell
pip install get_reader
```

To install optional support for MS Excel and DBF files (dBase,
Foxpro, etc.), use the following:

```shell
pip install get_reader[excel,dbf]
```

**Python 2 Support Statement**

While official support for Python 2 ends January 1, 2020, the
`get_reader` project will continue to test against and support
older versions of Python as long as the current testing ecosystem
provides the ability to do so.


Reference
---------

**get\_reader**(*obj*, \**args*, \*\**kwds*)

Return a `Reader` object which will iterate over records in
the given *obj*---like a `csv.reader()`.

The given *obj* is checked against supported types and passed to
the appropriate constructor if a match is found. If *obj* is a
string, it is treated as a file path whose extension determines
its content type. Any \**args* and \*\**kwds* are passed along to
the matching constructor:

```python
from get_reader import get_reader
...

# CSV file.
reader = get_reader('myfile.csv')

# Database connection.
connection = ...
reader = get_reader(connection, 'SELECT col1, col2 FROM mytable;')

# Pandas DataFrame.
df = pd.DataFrame([...])
reader = get_reader(df)

# Excel file.
reader = get_reader('myfile.xlsx', worksheet='Sheet2')

# DBF file.
reader = get_reader('myfile.dbf')
```

When *obj* is a path, the `Reader` contains a file object that
is handled internally. When given a file-like *obj* (rather than
a path), users are responsible for properly closing this file
themselves.

If the *obj* type cannot be determined automatically, users can
call the "`from_...()`" constructor methods directly.

> This method assumes that record contents are consistent. If the first

> **from\_sql**(*connection*, *table\_or\_query*)
>

> Read records from a specified table:

> ```python

> Read records from the results of a SQL query:
>
> ```python

> **from\_excel**(*path*, *worksheet*=0)
>
> Return a reader object which will iterate over lines in the given
> Excel worksheet. The *path* must specify an XLSX or XLS file and
> *worksheet* must specify the index or name of the worksheet to
> load (defaults to the first worksheet).
>
> Load first worksheet:
>
> ```python
> from get_reader import get_reader
>
> reader = get_reader.from_excel('mydata.xlsx')
> ```
>
> Specific worksheets can be loaded by name (a string) or index
> (an integer):
>
> ```python
> reader = get_reader.from_excel('mydata.xlsx', 'Sheet 2')
> ```


> **from\_pandas**(*obj*, *index*=True)
>
> Return a reader object which will iterate over records in
> a pandas `DataFrame`, `Series`, `Index` or `MultiIndex`.


> **from\_dbf**(*filename*, *encoding*=None, \*\**kwds*)
>
> Return a reader object which will iterate over lines in the given
> DBF file (from dBase, FoxPro, etc.).


> **from\_squint**(*obj*, *fieldnames*=None)
>
> Return a reader object which will iterate over the records returned
> from a squint `Select`, `Query`, or `Result`. If the *fieldnames*

*class* **Reader**(*iterable*, *closefunc=\<no value\>*)

An iterator which will produce rows from the given *iterable*.
By convention the first row is expected to be a header. The given
*iterable* can be any `ReaderLike` object. The optional *closefunc*
will be called to close any associated resources (files, database
cursors, etc.) when:

* the iterable is exhausted
* the Reader is deleted
* exiting a `with` statement (if used as a context manager)


> **close**()
>
> Closes any associated resources (calls *closefunc* early).
> If the resources have already been closed, this method passes
> without error.


*class* **ReaderLike**()

An abstract class that can be used for type checking. Objects
will test as `ReaderLike` if they are instances of `Reader` or
`csv.reader()` or if they are non-exhaustible iterables that
produce non-string sequences:

```python
>>> isinstance(csv.reader(csvfile), ReaderLike)
True

>>> isinstance(get_reader(csvfile), ReaderLike)
True

>>> list_of_lists = [['col1', 'col2'], ['a', 'b']]
>>> isinstance(list_of_lists, ReaderLike)
True

>>> list_of_strings = ['col1,col2', 'a,b']
>>> isinstance(list_of_strings, ReaderLike)
False
```
