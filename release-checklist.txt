Release Checklist
=================

1. Make sure correct version number is set in the get_reader.py file.

2. Update README.md and CHANGELOG files as appropriate.

3. Commit and push final changes to upstream repository:

     Prepare version info, CHANGELOG, and README for version X.X.X release.

4. Perform final checks to make sure there are no test failures.

5. Remove all existing files in the dist/ folder.

6. Build new distributions:

   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

7. Upload source and wheel distributions to PyPI:

   twine upload dist/*

8. Double check PyPI project page and test installation from PyPI.

9. Add version tag to upstream repository (also used by readthedocs.org).

10. Iterate version number in get_reader.py indicating that it is a development
    version (e.g., X.X.X.dev0) so that "latest" docs aren't confused with the
    just-published "stable" docs.

    Commit this change with a comment like the one below:

      Iterate version number to differentiate development version
      from latest release.

11. Publish update announcement to relevant mailing lists:

  python-announce-list@python.org
